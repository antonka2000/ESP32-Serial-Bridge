# ESP32-Serial-Bridge
Serial to Wifi Serial Bridge

This project is based on the original ESP32 Serial Bridge from "AlphaLima".

Soldering with single components is time consuming and not reliable.

Thats why I developed a PCB with all the components on it.

The Software had to be modified to be more user friendly when working with it.
